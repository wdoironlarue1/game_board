This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project is a simple board game web app at https://wdoironlarue1.github.io/game_board/ that anyone can visit.

Currently it only has checkers but most of the components can be reused to be used for other board games like chess.

### Possible improvements:
- implement chess game
- add tests
- improve visual aspect
- maybe add some animations
- use css compiler like less or sass
- create a p v computer option??
